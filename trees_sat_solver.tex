% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 10pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[10pt,journal,cspaper,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{}Phylogenetic network is a powerful tool to model the reticulate
evolutionary processes (such as horizontal gene transfer and hybrid specification).
Briefly, phylogenetic network is a directed acyclic graph, which has
nodes (called reticulation nodes) with more than one incoming edge. Phylogenetic
networks have been studied by several researchers \cite{huson}, \cite{morrison}, 
\cite{nakhleh}. There are several formulations of phylogenetic network
construction problem with various modeling assumptions and different types of input data. 
In this paper we focus on the specific type of phylogenetic network called hybridization
network \cite{semple}.

Input data for hybridization network construction is a set of gene trees. Each gene tree
models the evolutionary history of some gene. Becaues of the reticulate evolutionary events
these trees can have different topologies. The aim is to construct a phylogenetic network
containing the smallest possible number of reticulation nodes and displaying each of the input trees. 

Most of the algorithms for phylogenetic network construction are heuristic. However, recently
an exact algorithm PIRN has been intoduced \cite{wu}. In this paper we introduce a new approach for parsimonius
phylogenetic network construction based on SAT-solver usage. SAT-solver is a software package designed
to solve SAT problem, which consists of finding a satisfying assignment for a boolean formula. 
SAT problem is known to be NP-complete \cite{}, but state-of-the-art SAT-solvers running on the modern hardware 
are able to solve SAT instances having tens of thousands of variables and hundreds of thousands of clauses in several minutes.

SAT-solver based algorithms have been successfully applied to efficiently calculate evolutionary tree measures \cite{bonet}
as well as to solve problems in other domains such as
finite-state machine induction \cite{heule}, software verification \cite{}, ...

The general outline of our approach is to convert an instance of phylogenetic network construction 
problem to an instance of SAT problem (a Boolean formula), solve it using SAT-solver and then convert 
the satisfying assignment into the phylogenetic network. The formula construction process should ensure that
the network has the minimal possible number of reticulate nodes.

Our approach leads to an exact algorithm outperforming PIRN on ??? testcases out of ???

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives the formal definitions, section 3 describes the Boolean formula
construction process and section 4 gives the experimental results.

\section{Definitions and Background}

We define a "phylogenetic tree" as a leaf-labeled tree constructed over a set of taxa. Throughout this paper we assume that trees are rooted and binary, i.e. in-degrees of all nodes, except root, are one, and out-degrees are zero for leaves and two for internal nodes. A "hybridisation network" is a directed acyclic graph with a single root and leaves bijectively labeled by the set of taxa. If the in-degree of a node is greater than one, such node is called hybridisation node. In this paper we assume that hybridisation nodes have in-degree of two and out-degree of one. We can do this assumption by noting that we can convert a hybridisation node with in-degree of three or more to the sequence of hybridisation nodes of in-degree two \cite{Y. Wu. Close lower and upper bounds for the minimum reticulate network of multiple phylogenetic trees}. Other nodes are regular tree nodes and have the same properties as in tree.

Consider a hybridisation network $N$. Firstly we keep only one of the incoming edges for each hybridisation node in $N$. Secondly we contract edges to remove all the nodes of in-degree one and out-degree one. With this two steps we obtain a tree $T'$ from the network $N$.

Now suppose we have a phylogenetic tree $T$ and a hybridisation network $N$. We say that network $N$ \emph{displays} $T$ if we can choose the edges of hybridisation nodes in such a way that after edge-contraction obtained tree $T'$ will be equivalent to $T$.

A "hybridisation number" is commonly defined as the sum of in-degrees of all edges minus one. Note that under our assumptions $h(N)$ simply equals the number of reticulation nodes.

$h(N) = \sum\limits_{v != root} (d^-(v) - 1)$

Suppose we are given a set of $K$ phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2, ... T_k$ over the same set of taxa. The minimum hybridisation network for that set of trees is a network $N_{min}$ that displays each tree and has the lowest hybridisation number possible.

The most parsimonious hybridisation network problem.

Given a set of $K$ phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2, ... T_k$ over the same set of taxa, construct the minimum hybridisation network for that set of trees.

It has been shown that even for the case of $K=2$ construction of such a network is NP-complete problem \cite {M. Bordewich and C. Semple. Computing the minimum number of hybridization events for a consistent evolutionary history.}. As far as we know there exists only one algorithm for the construction of the most parsimonious hybridisation network \cite {wu}.


\section{Algorithm}

The main idea of the algorithm is to look over possible values if hybridisation number and to construct a boolean formula that represent a hybridisation network with fixed hybridisation number. Before doing this search we do some preprocessing and consequently some postprocessing after the network is found.


\subsection{Preprocessing}

Before the actual boolean formula encoding we modify the input and split it into several tasks to reduce the size and complexity of the problem. We do this according to the rules from \cite {Efficiently Calculating Evolutionary Tree Measures Using SAT Maria Luisa Bonet1 and Katherine St. John2}. To define those rules we first need to define the term "cluster". A set of taxa $A$ is a cluster in trees $T_1, T_2, ... T_k$ if there exists a node in each tree that has all the taxa from $A$ in its descendants.

\textbf{Subtree reduction rule}

Replace any subtree that appears identically in all input trees by a leaf with new label.

\textbf{Cluster reduction rule}

For each cluster $A$ replace the subtrees containing it by a leaf with new label and add a new task for processing that consists of deleted subtrees $T'_1, T'_2, ... T'_k$ with leaf set $A$.

After we split the task into a set of less complex tasks, we add a dummy root to each tree of each task along with the new dummy leaf for tree consistency. This is done to ensure that all the trees in the input share common root. This dummy root will be deleted on the postprocessing stage. At this stage we have a set of tasks that will be solved separately and then their results will be merged at the postprocessing stage.

\subsection{Search of the minimal hybridisation number}

To solve a subtask we need to find the lowest hybridisation number $k$ such that there exists a hybridisation network with this hybridisation number. We look through possible values of $k$ starting from the highest (?? why do we choose max $k$ equals to the size of taxa ??) and construct a boolean formula corresponding to that $k$. We decrease $k$ until the solver can't satisfy the formula, and that means that the previous value of $k$ was the lowest possible. There are another strategies of searching the minimal value of $k$. For example we can start from zero and increase $k$ until the solver will be able to satisfy the formula, or we can use binary search. But in our experiments the most time-consuming computations were with the value of $k_{optimal} - 1$ and consequently results of upwards method were very poor. Binary search results were close to downwards method, but in some cases when binary search tried to satisfy formulas with values of $k$ less than $k_{optimal}$ its results also were poor. This can be explained by an observation that it is much easier to solver to produce an answer if formula is satisfiable than if it is not. In case of unsatisfiable formula solver should check every possible answer to ensure that there is no solution. Obvious method for reducing searching time is to use different heuristics for finding close starting upper and lower bounds of hybridisation number. Possible candidates are PIRN, RIATA-HGT and MURPAR. We do not consider this optimisations in this paper.

\subsection{Encoding boolean formula}

Having a set of trees $T$ over a set of taxa $N$ and fixed hybridisation number $k$ we will construct boolean formula that will be satisfiable iff there exists a hybridisation network that displays each tree in $T$ and its hybridisation number equals to $k$. To do this we first notice that a network over the set of taxa of size $n$ with hybridisation number $k$ will have $2 * (n + k) - 1$ nodes (?? why ??). As we add dummy root and dummy leaf, we finally have $2 * (n + k) + 1$ nodes, $k$ of which are hybridisation nodes, $n + 1$ are leaves and others are usual tree nodes. Let $R$ be the set of hybridisation nodes, $L$ be the set of leaves and $V$ be the set of regural nodes. We number all the nodes in such a way that all leaves have numbers in range $[0,n]$, all regular nodes have numbers in range $[n + 1,2n + k]$ and all hybridisation nodes have numbers in range $[2n + k + 1, 2(n + k)]$. And we assume that the number of any leave or regular node is less than number of its parent. Such numeration allows us to define the following sets of nodes for each node $v$: $PC(v)$ is the set of possible children of $v$, $PP(v)$ is the set of possible parents of $v$ and $PU(v)$ is the set of nodes that can be indirect parents of $v$. Now we will describe literals and clauses required to construct boolean formula in conjunctive normal form.

\subsubsection{Network structure encoding}

First of all we encode structure of the network itself. We introduce the following literals: 

\begin{itemize}

\item $l_{v,u}(r_{v,u}) \forall v \in V, u \in PC(v)$ is true iff regular node $v$ has node $u$ as left (right) child.

\item $p_{v,u} \forall v \in L \cup V / root, u \in PP(v)$ is true iff $u$ is parent of regular node $v$.

\item $lp_{v,u}(rp_{v,u}) \forall v \in R, u \in PP(v)$ is true iff $u$ is left (right) parent of hybridisation node $v$.

\item $ch_{v,u} \forall v \in R, u \in PC(v)$ is true iff $u$ is child of hybridisation node $v$.

\end{itemize}

So we have $O((n + k) ^ 2)$ literals for specifying network structure. In practice the number of literals will be much smaller because sets $PP$ and $PC$ always contain less then $n+k$ nodes.

An obvious pattern to allow existence of only one parent or child or any other variable is to say that the node can have at least one true literal and at most one true literal. This can be done in the following way (for example for parents of regular node $v$):

$(\bigvee\limits_{u \in PP(v)} p_{v,u}) \wedge (\bigwedge\limits_{i, j \in PP(v);i < j} (\neg p_{v,i} \vee \neg p_{v,j}))$.

We introduce the following constraints to restrict the network structure:

\begin{itemize}

\item at-most-one and at-least-one clauses for literals $l$, $r$, $p$, $lp$, $rp$, $ch$

\item left child must have less number then the right one. This constraint can be translated as 
      $(\neg l_{v,u} \vee \neg r_{v,w}) \forall u, w \in PC(v): u \geq w$
      
\item same constraint for parents of hybridisation nodes.

\end{itemize}

We should connect parent literals with children literals for network consistency. We do this with the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}

\item if regular node has regular children then children should have this node as parent and vice versa:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $(\neg left_{v,u} \vee parent_{u,v})$ means if $u$ is the left child of $v$ then $v$ should be the parent of $u$
    \item $(\neg right_{v,u} \vee parent_{u,v})$ means same for the right child
    \item $(\neg parent_{u,v} \vee left_{v,u} \vee right_{v,u})$ means if $v$ is the parent of $u$ then $v$ is either its right or left child
    \end{itemize}
The same idea applies also for other types of parent-child relations.

\item regular parents with hybridisation children
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $(\neg left_{v,u} \vee lp_{u,v} \vee rp_{u,v})$
    \item $(\neg right_{v,u} \vee lp_{u,v} \vee rp_{u,v})$
    \item $(\neg lp_{u,v} \vee left_{v,u} \vee right_{v,u})$
    \item $(\neg rp_{u,v} \vee left_{v,u} \vee right_{v,u})$
    \end{itemize}
    
\item hybridisation parents with regular children
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ($\neg ch_{v,u} \vee parent_{u,v}$)
    \item ($\neg parent_{u,v} \vee ch_{v,u}$)
    \end{itemize}
    
\item hybridisation parents with hybridisation children
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ($\neg ch_{v,u} \vee lp_{u,v} \vee rp_{u,v}$)
    \item ($\neg lp_{u,v} \vee ch_{v,u}$)
    \item ($\neg rp_{u,v} \vee ch_{v,u}$)
    \end{itemize}
    
\item we also should order parents and children of hybridisation nodes, for consistent numeration:
$\forall v, u, w: v \in R, u \in PC(v), w \in PP(v), w \leq u$:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ($\neg ch_{v,u} \vee \neg lp_{v,w}$)
    \item ($\neg ch_{v,u} \vee \neg rp_{v,w}$)
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mapping trees to network}

\subsubsection{Heuristics}

\subsection{Solving boolean formula}

To solve generated boolean formula we use a SAT-solver CryptoMiniSat 4.2.0. Choosing the most appropriate solver is not considered in current paper, however several experimentations were made by M. Bonet and K. John \cite {Efficiently Calculating Evolutionary Tree Measures Using SAT Maria Luisa Bonet and Katherine St. John} so it is one of the topics of further research.

\subsection{Postprocessing}

After solving a task we recover network from the SAT-solver output. After that we delete dummy root and appropriate leaf from the network. And when all the subtasks of the original task are solved, we join their networks in one hybridisation network corresponding to original task.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

\begin{IEEEbiography}{Vladimir Ulyantsev}
Biography text here.
\end{IEEEbiography}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
